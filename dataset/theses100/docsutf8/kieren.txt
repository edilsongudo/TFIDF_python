Abstract
Introduction The overall goal of the thesis was to investigate the nature of the healthy human self and the process of achieving health. This was undertaken by reviewing established self-theory and presenting a summary of each theory and its position with regard to self-composition, self-agency and the nature of the healthy self. An inclusive self-theory was then developed, congruent with reviewed literature, which positioned spirituality as the essential core of self. From the foundational Spiritual Theory of Self and the findings of the first study in this thesis, the Health Change Process Theory was developed to explain and predict how people achieve sustainable health. Three subsequent studies resulted in the construction and testing of a quantitative measure which enabled scientific investigation of the nature of the healthy self and the process of achieving health.

Method The methodology of the four studies in this thesis was based on the instrumental approach which posits that, while there are procedural differences between qualitative and quantitative methodologies, philosophically speaking, there is no fundamental difference as they are both equally applicable and valuable. Consequently, the methodology judged to be the most appropriate instrument to investigate each study's topic of inquiry was chosen rather than allegiance to either qualitative or quantitative methodology. The first study was qualitative, as it investigated the definition of health and the process by which it was achieved from the perspective of 30 people with chronic musculoskeletal impairments. The findings from this study provided the theoretical basis for the three subsequent questionnaire development and validation studies. The second study used qualitative methodology with 59 participants to identify participant-generated items used in a new quantitative holistic health questionnaire and then employed quantitative methods to perform preliminary tests of the reliability and validity of this measure. The third study used quantitative methods with 233 participants to evaluate more robustly the reliability, content and concurrent validity of the original developmental measure and another, behaviourally-orientated assessment instrument, which used the identical item content but re-framed in the past tense. The fourth study employed

Results The critical review of self-theory concluded with the development of the Spiritual Theory of Self. The initial study supported this theory as a robust explanation and predictor of the determinants of a healthy self. Furthermore, the findings of this study and a review of relevant literature concluded with the development of a Health Change Process Theory, which was based on the Spiritual Theory of Self. The Health Change Process Theory explains and predicts the process by which a healthy self develops. The subsequent questionnaire development and validation studies sought to provide a quantitative holistic assessment tool, congruent with the Health Change Process Theory, and found the 28-item QE Health Scale (QEHS) to be a reliable and valid measure of holistic health. These results also demonstrated that the Health Change Process Theory and the underpinning Spiritual Theory of Self were robust. With regard to clinical application, the QEHS was found to aid assessment, therapeutic intervention, a client-centred holistic approach to healthcare and evidenced-based practice. The Patient Profile, derived from QEHS responses, provided a tool that enabled theory to be applied to practice by identifying the key indicator personal attributes determining holistic health status.

Conclusion The research results demonstrated that the Spiritual Theory of Self and the Health Change Process Theory provide valid explanations of the constructs that enable people with musculoskeletal disorders to remain otherwise healthy with such conditions. Furthermore, the relationship between the findings and established self-theories suggest that the Spiritual Theory of Self and the Health Change Process Theory may advance knowledge of the predictors and interventions that enable all people to undertake a health-enhancing process of change when confronted with adversity. The QEHS and associated Patient Profile were found to be reliable and valid tools that facilitated assessment and enhancement of the holistic health status for people

with musculoskeletal impairments. These tools identified barriers to achievement of holistic health, predicted by the Health Change Process Theory; facilitated the therapeutic process through a focus on issues meaningful to those receiving healthcare; aided treatment decision making; and enabled quantitative evidencebased evaluation of the efficacy of interventions. Moreover, the overall results have advanced psychological knowledge with implications for all fields of psychology involved in the study of people. The evidence of the research undertaken provides a basis for promoting knowledge and research of chronic healthcare delivery and a spiritually based conception of self and health. The QEHS and associated theories provide a tool and basis for investigations where people are experiencing traumatic, irreversible crises. However, the initial aims of further research should be to refine the QEHS and the associated Patient Profile to enable the use of theory and the QEHS across a diverse range of research populations and to investigate the applicability of these to facilitate the maintenance or achievement of a healthy self.

Personal Statement
Kieren Faull is married to Gail with three sons; Kerri, Ashley and Matti. Gail and Kerri (20) farm their 500-acre sheep and beef farm at Mohakatino, North Taranaki, New Zealand. Ashley (16) is a keen pig hunter and an outdoorsman and Matti (12) enjoys off-road vehicles, schoolwork, computer games and food. Kieren began studying psychology at Otago University in 1972. After two years he undertook 20 years of applied study; first as a shepherd in Taihape, next a fencing contractor and then a shearing contractor in Taranaki and the King Country. More intensive study of human nature and coping with the uncertainty of life was a necessary prerequisite of Kieren's individualised health psychology tuition. The Faulls purchased a farm in 1981, timing it so that within six months there was a change of government, subsidies disappeared, farm incomes plummeted, land prices slumped and interest soared. To further professional development; Kerri was diagnosed with a rare form of virtually medically unmanageable epilepsy in 1986, affecting his intellectual development, which was re-diagnosed at a latter date as autism. Observation of Kerri and experience with the health and education system enabled Kieren to acquire specialist knowledge of the processes for healthy coping with adversity. The next component of the health psychology programme began in the early 1990s. Things were beginning to work out for the Faull family. They built their home on the Mohakatino farm, which along with the shearing business was quite profitable. Full-time farming was becoming more a reality than a dream. The next module of Kieren's training was then presented to him. He managed to acquire rheumatoid arthritis in 1995 facilitating the development of reflection and problem solving skills. This event ensured he could no longer carry on doing what he enjoyed and had structured his life around. This aspect of his training concluded with extensive participant-observer investigation of New Zealand health and disability provision, culminating in a rehabilitation programme at his future PhD thesis study site, QE Health, Rotorua, New Zealand.

Kieren then returned to complete the academic requirements of his life-long plan to be a health psychologist. He completed his BA (Massey University) and then his MSocSci (Waikato). However, field work was not yet complete. In the final year of PhD study, Gail decided to contract breast cancer, requiring both Kieren and Gail to apply the theories his PhD proposed in their own lives yet again. His career plan, formulated 30 years ago, reached the employment phase a few years ago. Kieren is currently employed as the QE Health Researcher/Clinical Development Facilitator, undertaking and facilitating research, audit, professional and personal development and organisational change.

PREFACE
Background The overall goal of this thesis was to explore how people either remain or become healthy through the experience of a change event that results in a personal crisis of the self. In particular, this thesis explores the possibility that to be a healthy human being requires a view of self that encapsulates more than just biopsychosocial aspects. It is proposed that for the material biopsychosocial self to be healthy, meaningful and resilient, there is a need for the individual to acknowledge and increase awareness of the foundational component of self as nonmaterial, that is, possessing properties inconsistent with material entities. Examples of change events that may precipitate a personal crisis of self include natural disasters, war, immigration, loss or change of occupation, loss of significant others and ill-health. In this thesis, the experiences of people with a chronic physical impairment were employed to examine this notion. The term commonly used in reference to the nonmaterial aspect of self is spirituality. There has been a quantity of qualitative research undertaken to observe and record the characteristics of this phenomenon. There appears to be a consensus that self awareness of the spiritual and highly subjective core of self results in specific types of relationships, connections and self-perspectives. Beyond that, there is no one consensual, clear and precise definition of spirituality evident in the scientific literature. Moreover, the tendency in much of the literature is to associate spirituality with religion, implying that these concepts are similar, if not identical. Consequently, it is implied that spirituality is not the nonmaterial basis of all life but rather a phenomenon peculiar to humans and defined by particular prescriptive beliefs concerning life. In contrast, others view spirituality and religion as distinctly different, often opposing concepts. Within this perspective spirituality is considered to possess properties that behave in a manner distinctly different from the more observable, material aspects of this world. However, the nonmaterial is assumed to be able to somehow integrate with the material to become an indivisible whole. From this view, the material and nonmaterial are not distinct and separate but somehow complementary and integral components of life.

1

Hence, spirituality is not seen as solely a part of human composition but rather the basis of all life. This thesis adopts the latter conception of spirituality. Consequently, in this thesis the concept of spirituality is employed in a specific and particular manner. First, as it appears too early in the process of scientific investigation of this phenomenon for accurate, detailed description of what spirituality is, scientific investigation must rely on description and measurement of the impact of spirituality on the objective world. The literature on spirituality and health indicates that there is uniformity of description of the impact of spirituality on personal relationships, connections, meanings and beliefs. Therefore, these universal descriptors of the characteristics of the impact of spirituality on the biopsychosocial self were employed to provide an operational definition of this phenomenon. For many people, the perception of being fully human involves an experience of interconnection and interrelatedness that also encompasses the objective reality of physical or material separateness. The term spirituality also emphasises the essential subjectivity of human perception and the present limitations of knowledge in this area. Spirituality is about relationships and connections that enable individuals to resolve seeming contradictions. For example, it enables the individual to perceive the self not only as separate, special and unique but also as a minuscule and integral component of the whole of life. Spirituality is proposed to be the component of life that enables relationships and connections to transcend the separateness of self and of temporal realities and to bind together all that is life, resulting in extension, connections and integration of the biopsychosocial being with self and the world. Moreover, the concept of spirituality was employed to emphasise the essentially subjective nature of the human experience and to distinguish it from culturally specific behaviours and beliefs (religion) that do not necessarily include spirituality. While acknowledging that all people possess strong beliefs, the exact nature of these is idiosyncratic. Moreover, from the spiritual perspective, a person is viewed as an integral, unique but miniscule component of the whole. Therefore, individual beliefs are perceived as, at best, partial knowledge rather than absolute knowledge. While people may have an inner surety that their partial knowledge is `right' they cannot claim that it is complete. Consequently,
2

from the spiritual perspective, beliefs are seen as tentative and constantly changing and developing. Hence, beliefs should be constantly evolving and for this reason are believed not to be amenable to scientific investigation of universal commonalities. Within the context of the thesis research, that is healthcare delivery, it is considered that investigation of the health benefits of particular belief systems is not scientifically credible. Consequently, this thesis aimed to begin quantitative investigation of the relationships between the concepts of spirituality, health and self by developing a theory of personal change, based on a spiritual conception of self, and to construct a measurement tool to assess the effects of such spiritual awareness on the biopsychosocial components of self as individuals experienced change events that instigated a crisis of self. The experience of chronic physical impairment was employed as an accessible sample representing a change event likely to cause a personal crisis of self. The thesis was based on the following assumptions regarding the state of spiritual theory and measurement of self and health: 1. At this point in time, science is limited by its degree of technological sophistication to not being able to directly observe or measure `spirituality'. Nevertheless, science can develop quantitative tools to measure the predicted effects of this phenomenon on the biopsychosocial self. Constructing instruments to measure effects rather than the entity itself is an accepted scientific method of investigation of subjective concepts (e.g., wind and temperature). 2. However, measurement of self and health typically assumes that multifaceted measurement of objective function and dysfunction will identify the individual's health status. In essence such measurement requires momentarily freezing the object of measurement as separate and distinct from other objects. By doing so, the dynamic, fluid, interconnected and holistic nature of life is not measured. Quantum physics appears to be at the forefront of those attempting to address this problem. 3. Conceptions of self reinforce the division of the material from the nonmaterial in healthcare and can be classified according to the
3

philosophical reasoning that underpins psychology. That is, historically it has been assumed that the composition of people can be reasoned to be material or nonmaterial but not both. 4. The central issue that has lead to the conclusion of distinctness, incompatibility and separateness of material and nonmaterial entities is the assumption that these entities possess opposing and mutually exclusive properties. Much of this rationale is based on knowledge of the material world as represented by classical physics. 5. There is a need to address this fundamental issue of the separateness of the material and nonmaterial in self-theory in order to construct a view of each self theory as a coherent part of the whole. To do so, this thesis reviews self-theory from the material Â­ nonmaterial viewpoint and seeks to construct a rudimentary holistic theory of self from existing evidence. In essence the aim is to attempt to explore established evidence from a different perspective and construct a measure from this perspective. The specific questions addressed in this thesis are: 1. When people are healthy, how do they perceive themselves? Specifically, what do they perceive themselves as composed of and what degree of personal control do they perceive they have over their lives? 2. How are healthy people able to remain healthy when confronted by major change events? 3. How can major change events become opportunities to be healthy?

Thesis Aims The overall goal of the thesis was to investigate the nature of the healthy human self and the process of achieving health. To achieve this goal, the following sequential aims were addressed. The first aim was to develop a concept of self, based on existing evidence of the nature of the healthy human self, and incorporating spirituality as a fundamental component of self. Chapter One categorises existing self-theories within a material-nonmaterial framework, presenting a synopsis of each theory and an accompanying outline of each theorist's conception of self-composition, selfagency and the healthy self. Chapter Two then critically examines the rationale of
4

these theories. Chapter Three considers the results of the Chapter Two critical review and related literature, and concludes with a Spiritual Theory of Self. The second aim, to test and refine the characteristics of the healthy spiritual self, is addressed in Chapter Six. This first study (the HSD Study) sought to investigate the robustness of the Spiritual Theory of Self and asked two questions, "What is health for you" and "How did you achieve this health?" of a sample of people with chronic physical impairment. Chapter Seven addresses the third thesis aim. This was to develop change theory explaining the process by which people develop a spiritually-based and healthy self. The Spiritual Theory of Self, the conclusions of the HSD Study, and relevant literature were all examined to develop the Health Change Process Theory. The fourth aim was to use the Health Change Process Theory, developed in Chapter Seven, to derive factors and develop potential measures of these factors in order to discriminate a sustainable healthy self from others. The second study, the SIQS Study (Chapter 8), resulted in the development of two possible measures. The fifth aim, addressed in the HAS Study (Chapter 9), was to ev
